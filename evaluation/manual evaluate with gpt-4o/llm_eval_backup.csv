Individual Health Insurance
Individual health insurance plans cover the medical expenses of a single person. You can have an individual policy for every member of the family separately. It provides extensive coverage and can be customised to align with the specific needs and the individual’s medical condition. 

The premium for these plans depends on the gender, age, medical history, etc., of the policyholder. Also, the lifetime renewability feature of the plan facilitates coverage for an extended period without worrying about frequent renewals. 

Family Floater Health Insurance
This plan improves the outlook on the meaning of health insurance and its importance. The family floater policies provide coverage for the entire family. You can plan your family's healthcare with a single plan. The insured sum gets distributed among all the family members. The premium is much lower compared to individual healthcare plans. 

Older members are more prone to health issues that incur heavy treatment expenses that may use up the entire coverage. This health plan suits a household with younger individuals wherein the sum assured is available to all the members as they are less prone to health issues. 

Senior Citizens Health Insurance
Issues that are of less concern in younger days may seem serious as you age. Treatment for age-related issues can be expensive and financially stressful without a MediClaim policy. This plan is for individuals over 60 years old. It covers various pre-existing conditions and provides more coverage for specific age-related health conditions. Treatment costs for injuries due to unforeseen accidents can drain retirement savings. 

The injury coverage in a health insurance plan protects your savings. Senior citizens who understand what is health insurance and its benefits will certainly plan for their health needs with a senior citizen health insurance plan. 

Critical Illness Insurance
If you understand the health insurance meaning and appreciate the various benefits, you also need to know critical illness insurance to derive the most out of the illness coverage. Critical illness insurance provides coverage for terminal illnesses like cancer, stroke, heart disease, kidney failure, etc. 

The coverage is also available as an add-on@ to basic plans which proves more economical. This plan provides a lump sum amount when the policyholder is diagnosed with any critical illness listed in the plan. You can use the amount to pay for surgical expenses, medicines, hospitalisation bills, and any other related expenses. 

Group Health Insurance
Group health insurance covers a group of people. Companies and organisations invest in group plans to provide health coverage for their employees or members. The employees can choose to cover their family members under the same plan. 

This policy covers a range of medical needs and also extends maternity benefits and covers daycare treatments. The advantage of this plan is the instant coverage for pre-existing illnesses. 

Top-up Health Insurance
You will be more open to selecting a healthcare plan when you understand the health insurance meaning and the benefits of top-up health insurance. Top-up health insurance provides coverage over and above an existing mediclaim policy or a group insurance plan. 

You can utilise the additional coverage for hospitalization and other related expenses after the sum assured under the regular health insurance plan is exhausted. 

Maternity Health Insurance
An insight into maternity health insurance provides a broader perspective on the meaning of health insurance. This medical policy covers to-be mothers and pregnant women. It covers delivery expenses for both normal and C-section delivery. The medical reimbursement under this plan includes pre and post-natal care expenses, newborn baby expenses, prescription medicines, hospitalisation, tests, etc.","There are many types of health insurance.

2. **Preferred Provider Organization (PPO)**: Offers more flexibility in choosing healthcare providers. Members can see any doctor, but will pay less if they use providers in the plan’s network.

3. **Exclusive Provider Organization (EPO)**: Similar to PPOs, but members must use network providers for coverage, except in emergencies. No referrals are needed to see specialists.

4. **Point of Service (POS)**: Combines features of HMO and PPO plans. Members choose a primary care physician and need referrals to see specialists but can see out-of-network providers at a higher cost.

5. **High Deductible Health Plan (HDHP)**: Features lower premiums but higher deductibles. Often paired with Health Savings Accounts (HSAs), allowing members to save money tax-free for medical expenses.

6. **Catastrophic Health Insurance**: Designed for younger, healthier individuals. It has lower premiums but high deductibles and primarily covers emergencies and serious health issues.

1. **Premiums**: You pay a regular fee (monthly, quarterly, or annually) to maintain your health insurance coverage. This is known as your premium.

2. **Deductibles**: Before your insurance starts paying for covered services, you usually need to pay a certain amount out of pocket, called a deductible. For example, if your deductible is $1,000, you’ll pay the first $1,000 in medical costs yourself.

3. **Co-pays and Coinsurance**: After you've met your deductible, you may still need to pay a portion of your medical costs. Co-pays are fixed amounts (e.g., $20 for a doctor’s visit), while coinsurance is a percentage of the total cost (e.g., you pay 20% of the bill).

Life insurance provides financial security for your family when you are gone from your life, whereas a health insurance plan provides for treatment costs to keep you alive. The other reasons to select a healthcare plan are:

Financial Security 
It serves as a financial safety net when you encounter a medical emergency. It manages the treatment costs and spares you from the financial burden.

Access to Good Healthcare
Treatment at reputed hospitals and access to better benefits can diminish your savings if you do not have health insurance. Health insurance takes care of the rising medical costs and enables access to good healthcare.

Cashless Treatment
Without upfront payments, a cashless treatment facility initiates treatment immediately. Elaborate admission procedures and paperwork can delay the treatment. With health insurance, the insurers coordinate directly with the hospital and expedite the process. 

Tax Benefits
You can reduce tax liability with a health insurance plan. A deduction of up to Rs. 25000/- (Rs. 50000/- if the insurer of any family member is above 60 years) is allowed under Section 80D1.

How to Choose a Health Insurance Plan?
The tips for choosing the best health insurance plan are as important as knowing what is medical insurance. They are:

Check the Sum Insured
Assessing your healthcare needs is essential before you decide on the sum insured. You should consider your pre-existing illness, your family medical history, the rising cost, etc. In the absence of the right sum assured, the purpose of health insurance will not be served. The sum assured should also be able to beat inflation to be able to meet the expenses in the future. 

Scout the Network Hospitals
You should look for network hospitals included in the plan. Choose a plan with network hospitals close to your residence to be able to reach out immediately in case of emergencies and also have the convenience of cashless treatment. 

Check the Fine Print
Read the fine print in the plan for clarity about limitations and exclusions such as waiting periods, deductibles, sub-limits, etc. A plan with lower or no co-payments is recommended to reduce your contribution. 

Look for Additional Benefits
Health insurance plans with additional benefits can further reduce your stress. Look for plans with no claim bonus, the redemption of sum assured up to a maximum limit, and the provision for annual health check-ups that add value to the plan. 

Examine the Exclusions and Other Clauses
Read the terms and conditions of the plan to understand the exclusions and other clauses. These may come as a surprise when you file a claim and give rise to a financial crisis and delay in treatment which may cost your health. 

High Claim Settlement Ratio
The claim settlement ratio represents the total number of claims settled out of claims received in a financial year. An insurer with a high claim settlement ratio is more reliable.
